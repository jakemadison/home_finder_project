Okay, so Craigslist sucks.  Using craigslist sucks.  It's not an easy way to quickly go through a large amount of
content.

You know what _is_ good at looking through a whole lot of content? Tinder.

Let's make a Tinder-y interface for Craigslist posts!

Also, why doesn't craigslist attempt to match postings to you, the same way online dating sites do?
Maybe even one's that are smart enough to give better choices based on previous responses?

So, one end of this is just a nice way to find and save (and message via?) craigslist postings.

The other end is maybe some wacky decision tree classifier / random forrest / machine learning weirdness
to try and show the most pertinent posts first.
